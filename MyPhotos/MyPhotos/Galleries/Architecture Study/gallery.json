Hailey had an assignment from school to take architecture pictures. I thought Microsoft would be a great place for that. You will see in this set some of the newest buildings on campus at the Commons. Also some shots in some of the oldest buildings (1-4) and Lake Bill in the middle. Some of those old carp in that lake were probably put there in '95 when I started at the company. We left Microsoft and went down to the waterfront in Kirkland to finish off the afternoon. Beautiful day for mid-October!","GalleryLocation":"Microsoft Headquarters & Kirkland Waterfront","GalleryDate":"2014-10-11T00:00:00"}
