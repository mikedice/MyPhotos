<h2>MyPhotos - An Web Site by Mike Dice</h2>
<h3>This application was developed by me. I built this application so I can share my photography with family and friends that don't do Facebook. Hope you enjoy it!</h3>

<p>I have a lot of ideas for new features for this web site. I'll add them when I get some free time.</p>
